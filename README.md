# API_Resub
# Virtual Whiteboard with AR.js


This demo enables you to visualize and brainstorm information using augmented reality. AR.js provides a set of tools for making collaborative tools. In this demo we can visualize images and text and rearrange and sort the information how we see fit. We explored the augmented reality with an overlay. You can view just images or have the image with more information on display. Animations used make the text fade in nicely. 

Another ting to mention is that the idea is that you can also use this augmented whiteboard scenario anywhere. You don’t need an actual whiteboard to collaborate. The scenario projects its own surface to collaborate on, you just need a wall.

This scenario displays the use of images and object files. Note that you can add many other options to animate the objects how you see fit, which is documented here: https://aframe.io/docs/0.8.0/core/animations.html

The way to add objects in the GitHub repository is flawed and therefore we’ve added a troubleshooting section at the bottom that explains how we did it.
